# World Happiness Report Analysis

# Introduction
As a student of data analytics, I employed Python and Tableau to uncover trends within the World Happiness Report. My objective was to extract insights from the data in order to recommend improvements for policymakers to employ in various countries to enhance national happiness and overall well-being.

# Context
The World Happiness Report, compiled by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), assesses and ranks the happiness of countries worldwide using data from the Gallup World Poll. The goal is to provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to national happiness, helping policymakers and organizations improve the quality of life.

# Key Questions
-What is the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores?

-How does social support influence happiness scores in different countries?

-What is the correlation between life expectancy and happiness scores?

-How does freedom impact happiness scores?

-What is the relationship between generosity and happiness scores?

-How does government trust correlate with national happiness scores?
